# ReLeaf Team Project

## Getting Started

To start your application you should execute both client and server using these commands:

### `npm start` into root of the project

Runs the React app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm start` into the server folder

Runs the Express.js Server on port [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100)

Thanks to nodemon the server will restart automatically when you make changes.
